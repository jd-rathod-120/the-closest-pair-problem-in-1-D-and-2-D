# the-closest-pair-problem-in-1-D-and-2-D
(a) Write a program (use divide and conquer) for the closest pair problem in one dimen- sion. We are given an array of n points in the real line. Find a pair of points whose distance is minimum over all pairs of points. Note that here the distance has the usual meaning. (b) Write a program (use divide and conquer) for the closest pair problem. We are given an array of n points in the plane where each point is a pair (x, y), x- is the x-coordinate and y is the y-coordinate of the point. Find a pair of points whose distance is minimum over all pairs of points. Distance is the usual Euclidean distance.
